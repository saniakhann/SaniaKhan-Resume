        <p class="lead mb-4">As a third-year biology major at UC Riverside, I have already gained a significant amount of knowledge and experience in the field of biology. With my experience as a medical scribe, tutor, and hospital volunteer, I have likely developed a deep appreciation for the importance of biology in healthcare and medicine.
<br><br>

        As a medical scribe, I have likely gained valuable insight into the day-to-day workings of a healthcare facility. I have likely seen firsthand the importance of accurate and detailed medical records, as well as the critical role that healthcare professionals play in the lives of their patients. I may have also seen the impact of biology on medicine, such as the use of genetics to personalize treatment plans or the use of microbiology to identify infectious diseases.
As a tutor, I have likely had the opportunity to share your knowledge and passion for biology with others. I may have helped my peers understand complex concepts or prepare for exams, or you may have worked with younger students to foster their interest in science. Through tutoring, I have likely gained valuable communication and teaching skills, as well as a deeper understanding of the importance of biology education in promoting scientific literacy and advancing the field.
As a hospital volunteer, I have likely witnessed the direct impact of biology on the health and well-being of patients. I may have worked with patients of all ages and backgrounds, helping to provide comfort and support during their hospital stay. Through my volunteer work, I have likely gained a greater understanding of the complexities of healthcare and the critical role that biology plays in diagnosing and treating illness.
<br><br>

Overall, my experiences as a medical scribe, tutor, and hospital volunteer have likely reinforced the importance of biology in healthcare and medicine. Biology provides the foundation for many of the advances in medicine and healthcare, from the development of new treatments and therapies to the identification and prevention of diseases. As a biology major, I am well-positioned to make a meaningful contribution to the field of healthcare and medicine.
In my future studies and career, you may choose to specialize in a particular area of biology, such as genetics, microbiology, or immunology. I may also choose to pursue a career in medicine, nursing, or healthcare administration. Regardless of your path, my experiences as a medical scribe, tutor, and hospital volunteer have likely prepared me well for the challenges and opportunities ahead.
In conclusion, as a third-year biology major at UC Riverside, I have already gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in the field of biology. My experiences as a medical scribe, tutor, and hospital volunteer have likely reinforced the importance of biology in healthcare and medicine, and have prepared me well for my future studies and career. With my passion for biology and your commitment to helping others, I am well-positioned to make a meaningful contribution to the field of healthcare and medicine.
